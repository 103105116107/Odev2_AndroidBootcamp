This repository contains a collection of Kotlin functions developed as part of the Android Development Bootcamp. The project focuses on implementing logic for various mathematical, geometric, and practical computations.

Solved Challenges
The following methods have been implemented within this project:
Mathematical & Geometric Calculations
Internal Angle Sum: Calculates the sum of internal angles for a polygon based on the number of sides.
Formula: Sum = (n - 2) x 180
Temperature Conversion: Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Formula: F = C x 1.8 + 32
Rectangle Perimeter: Calculates the perimeter of a rectangle given its sides.

Factorial Calculation: Computes the factorial value of a given number.

Practical Logic
Salary Computation: Calculates monthly salary based on working days, including overtime pay.

Standard: 8 hours/day at 10 ₺/hr.

Overtime: Beyond 160 hours at 20 ₺/hr.

Data Usage Fee: Calculates internet billing based on quota usage.

Base: 100 ₺ for 50 GB.

Excess: 4 ₺ per additional 1 GB.

Character Counting: A function that counts the occurrences of the letter 'a' within a given string.

Technical Stack
Language: Kotlin 100%

Platform: Android

IDE: Android Studio

Installation
Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/103105116107/Odev2_AndroidBootcamp.git```

Open the project in Android Studio.
